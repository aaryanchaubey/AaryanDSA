Here Along with the folders you will find 3 files 
So if you want to create any specific folder for your practice solving 
copy input.in and output.in in that specific folder

coming to C++17 - its a build file ..
while you are coding in sublime - 
click on build - create new build system - a sample page is opened - 
copy the link of that directory - search that folder in file system -
move the C++17 file in that directory - you are ready to begin

Happy Coding !!
